[Ontology](https://ont.io/#/) is a new generation of high-performance public blockchains. The infrastructure is scalable, stable, and allows low-level customization for different business requirements. After the Ontology MainNet release, we have welcomed many new developers to the Ontology technical community and launched our [Developer Center ](https://bounty.ont.io/index.php/index/developer).
