[Ontology](https://ont.io/#/) puts forward a series of protocol standards. Proposals include an identity protocol, multi-source authentication protocol, user authorization protocol, distributed data exchange protocol and so on. Based on these protocols，Ontology provides products and frameworks for application developers to directly build distributed apps without having knowledge of how to develop a complicated distributed systems.This makes blockchain easy to use for all.

### Here you will get these products' documentations as below：

* ONT ID 

ONT ID establishes a cryptographic digital identity for every user, company, item and any other entity. Digital identity is based on Ontology block chain technology and is not restricted by any centralized organization. It is totally controlled by users themselves, and has the characteristics of security and credibility.

* ONTPass 

Based on ONTID and Ontological Trust Ecology, it is an open and decentralized authentication platform, providing rich authentication services for people, finance, material and affairs.

* Decentralized data exchange application framework(DDXF)

Based on the Ontology BlockChain and ONT ID protocols, DDXF perfectly implements digital asset decentralized transactions through consistent books, smart contracts, and cryptography. DDXF provides a series of smart contract templates, transaction components and cryptographic components. The upper application can easily implement data collaboration and sharing.

* Trust Anchor Connector

Trust Anchor refers to the partner that provides authentication services on the Ontology ecosystem. It may be government agencies, universities, banks, third-party authentication service agencies (such as CA agencies), biometric technology companies, etc. They provide multi-dimensional authentication for the owner of the ONT ID and record the HASH of authentication behavior and authentication result through the Ontology blockchain at the first time, thereby providing a standardized and credible authentication method for the user authentication requester.

Trust Anchor Connector(called for short:TAConnector) is a technology access component that helps Trust Anchors quickly access the ontology trust ecosystem.
